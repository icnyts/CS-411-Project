Tech stack for the API prototype call:
●	Javascript
●	HTML/CSS
●	Phaser: An open source html5 framework for creating games
●	Genius API
●	Postman for testing

Tech stack selection process:

We had a group meeting and discussion through GroupMe to decide the techstack for this demo web page. Given our previous experiences in development and the functions our application will be doing, we decided to choose the previously listed technologies.

For the API call, we initially considered calling Spotify API for this demo. However, the process to combine Spotify API and OAuth is relatively complicated and lacks clear documentation. According to the MVC standard for the deliverable product, we decided to use the Genius API, which we will also be using in our application. The process of authorizing and obtaining the client token was much easier than that of Spotify, and we will still be using the call to this API during our development process.

We have considered Melon.js, which is also a javascript library for creating games, but we finally decided to use Phaser.js instead. This is because Phaser.js is more light-weight, and works better with pure HTML and JavaScript.
